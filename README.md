# Keep Sensitive Data Safe and Private Codelab

This repository contains the code for the Android codelab "Keep Sensitive Data
Safe and Private".

This codelab will cover the correct way to store data securely in an Android
app, how to access data on the device securely and how to limit the amount of
data that apps expose. The codelab will start with a simple app that does not
follow recommended best practices and the developer will fix each API/area in
turn, covering content providers, local storage and directories and permission
access.

### Getting started
Follow the instructions on this page to get started.
